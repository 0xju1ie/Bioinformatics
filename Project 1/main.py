#PCR = denaturation, annealing, extension
#denaturing- heats it up and splits the dna in to the two seperate strands
#annealing- primers bind to a matching sections
#extension- starting from the primers the dna starts to be replicated by matching the base pairs of the template DNA.

#our template dna is 2000 base pairs long (n). This is created randomly, made up of A,T,C,G. (basically denaturing but not actually)
#our primers are 20 base pairs long and randomly generated.
#these primers will match up to a sequence in the template dna of 2000 base pairs.
#the primer then binds (annealing)
#now the dna can be replicated starting from the primer. This will go for a segment of about 200 (m)
#the stopping point of the replication/amplification is determined by d+r, d is equivalent to 200 (m) and r is random generated number between 50 and -50. So total length will be between 150 and 250.
